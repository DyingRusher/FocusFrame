First set input and output path at line 140 and 141
You can adjust how many frame u need to crop default is 1000(41 sec)

for simplicity i converted video to (720,540)

save detection of YOLO in variables

if no detection found crop most middle part of video

after detecting boxes of whole video sort objects of each frame in prority and prority goes like:
1.if there is person in frame focus on them
2.if two or more person then choose which has bigger area
3.if no person then choose biggest object in frame

and at last rolling average and backfill in mid values to give smooth cropping.
save both video original and cropped video in single frame.
